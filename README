System requirements:
- Operating Systems: Tested on Mac OS 10.15.5 and Windows 10 Enterprise
- Code requires R. Tested on R 4.0.4 and RStudio 1.1.456 (Mac) and R 4.1.3 and RStudio 1.4.1717 (Windows)
- No non-standard hardware is required

Installation guide:
- Required R packages (dependencies) are as loaded in individual .R files. All are available via CRAN and can be installed using typical install.packages('___') syntax. Installation should take under 5 minutes.
- Once required dependencies are installed, no further installation is required

Demo:
- Run the file code/Demo.R
- Expected output: a budget allocation matrix with zeros except for entries of 10,000 in the 9th row of the matrix.
- Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer: < 1 min

Instructions for use:
- To make figures, tables, and in text #s using provided .Rdata files containing the results of model output:
-- Run code/MakeMainTextFigures.R to make figures and #s in the main text.
-- Run code/MakeSIFigures.R to make figures & tables in the SI

- To run optimizations underlying main results:
*** Note: a single optimization using a single parameterization can take many hours to run. ***  
-- To run optimizations underlying results in the main text, run code in code/RunMainTextModels.R
-- To run optimizations underlying results in the SI, run code in code/RunSIModels.R
